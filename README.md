# DogoFit

Making this application to get some depth in C# and .NET.
I've never developed a mobile app before, so this is great practice.

This app uses .NET MAUI. Since it's cross-platform, I'll release it on Android, iOS, and Windows.

The app stores the data locally in a SQLite database. There's no protocol for cloud storage, and I'm not planning to implement that.
