Gym Log Workout Tracker

This is a learning project, and it's heavily inspired by [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/). I use [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/) a lot. I like it.


## Details

The application is written in C#, using the MAUI framework.

I am only planning to release on Android, but I might come around to iOS and Windows.
